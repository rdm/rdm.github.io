The [code.jsoftware.com wiki](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Wiki) (which is a mediawiki site) might wind up using [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) for some of its more "code-oriented" content.

While mediawiki offers a great set of presentation tools, github wikis provide better integration with developer workflows.

Also, we're working on putting together a webassembly implementation [of J](https://github.com/joebo/j-emscripten-src), and github provides the right kind of infrastructure for maintaining that kind of system.

Anyways.. for now, I am using rdm.github.io as a scratchpad for [demonstrating](example.html) some of the deployment-related concepts for this project for others on the team. (The link in this paragraph includes an html file which references an image file and a javascript file.)
